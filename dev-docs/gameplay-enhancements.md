# Gameplay Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major gameplay improvements implemented to address the identified fun factor and difficulty balance issues.

## LATEST UPDATE: Dash Removal & Speed Rebalance
- **Removed**: Buggy dash system completely
- **Changed**: Speed boosts are now permanent (no duration)
- **Increased**: Default player speed from 2 to 8 for better responsiveness
- **Reduced**: Speed powerup frequency dramatically (1/8 to 1/20 chance)

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Movement Monotony
**Problem**: Player restricted to vertical movement, enemies move in predictable straight lines
**Solution**: 
- Added sine wave movement patterns for Alien1 (gentle bobbing)
- Added spiral/curved movement patterns for Alien2 (more aggressive)
- Implemented player dash mechanics (double-tap arrow keys)

### 2. Power-up Imbalance  
**Problem**: Speed stacks infinitely, too frequent spawning
**Solution**:
- Speed cap at 6 maximum
- Duration-based system (15 seconds for speed, 10 seconds for multishot)
- Smart spawning (speed only when player speed < 4)
- Reduced spawn frequency significantly

### 3. Shallow Difficulty Curve
**Problem**: Linear enemy spawning, difficulty tied only to frequency
**Solution**:
- Formation-based enemy spawning (V-formations, lines, diamonds, swarms)
- Wave-based special events (SWARM, ELITE, MIXED, FINAL waves)
- Phase-specific enemy behavior and formations

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Enemy Movement
- **Alien1**: `Math.sin(frameCounter * 0.08) * 20` for gentle vertical bobbing
- **Alien2**: Complex spiral with `Math.sin() + Math.cos()` for unpredictable movement
- Both types maintain screen bounds checking

### Power-up System Rebalancing
- **Speed PowerUp**: 
  - Duration: 900 frames (15 seconds)
  - Cap: MAX_PLAYER_SPEED = 6
  - Spawn condition: Only when player.canReceiveSpeedBoost()
- **MultiShot PowerUp**:
  - Duration: 600 frames (10 seconds)  
  - Extra shots: 3 (total 4 shots)
  - Reserved for Phase 2+ combat

### Wave System
Special events at key timestamps:
- **Phase 2**: SWARM (6 enemies), ELITE (3 strong), MIXED (5 enemies)
- **Phase 3**: ELITE, SWARM, FINAL (4 enemies in diamond formation)
- Visual feedback with countdown timers and warnings

### Player Dash Mechanics
- **Activation**: Double-tap arrow keys within 15-frame window
- **Duration**: 8 frames of high-speed movement
- **Cooldown**: 120 frames (2 seconds)
- **Speed**: 15 pixels/frame during dash
- Visual feedback in dashboard

## Formation Patterns Implemented

### Phase 1: V-Formations
- 3 enemies in V-shape with staggered timing
- Introduces formation concept gradually

### Phase 2: Advanced Formations
- **Line formations**: Horizontal enemy lines
- **Diamond formations**: 4 enemies in diamond pattern with mixed types

### Phase 3: Elite Formations  
- **Swarm formations**: 4 enemies in tight proximity
- **Pincer formations**: Top/bottom attacks with center breakthrough
- **Final wave**: Structured diamond attack pattern

## Performance Optimizations
- Timer precision improved to 16ms for stable 60fps
- Star field rendering optimized (removed expensive glow effects)
- Rendering hints for speed optimization
- Collision detection remains efficient with added invincibility frames

## Visual Feedback Enhancements
- Phase indicators: "Safe", "Danger", "WAR!"
- Wave notifications with countdown timers
- Powerup status with remaining time
- Dash status and cooldown display
- Player blinking during invincibility frames

## Balancing Changes
- Powerup spawn frequency reduced by 60-80%
- Enemy formation spawning adds variety without overwhelming
- Speed powerups are contextual and temporary
- MultiShot reserved for intense combat phases
- Player dash adds tactical positioning without breaking vertical constraint

## Future Considerations
- Monitor player feedback on dash cooldown timing
- Consider adaptive difficulty based on player performance
- Potential for additional enemy types with unique movement patterns
- Wave system can be expanded with more complex formation types
